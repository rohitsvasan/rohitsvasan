About Me: Rohit Srinivasan

Ever since I was a young boy, I have always been very interested in cars and everything that they represent. Therefore, I aspire to have a career in automotive R&D engineering, particularly in jobs related to new technologies, as I have aspired to be at the forefront of new innovations that can create positive changes. Not only will it provide me with a high-paying career in the field that I enjoy, but it will also provide me with the opportunity to work towards things that are even more aspirational and exciting for me, such as developing cool high-performance cars and racecars. My plans for achieving these goals are to work hard, get good grades, keep practicing lots of math and computer science, and continue my extracurriculars to get into a good college and learn fundamental skills for these careers. Additionally, I would probably major in something like Electrical Engineering or Computer Science to gain a better understanding of the components and technology behind the cars we drive regularly. 

Some strengths related to this career choice are that I am good with math, have an A in Advanced Algebra 2, and have done several math activities outside of school like MPM, AOPS, AMC 8, and Math Kangaroo. These skills have all taught me how to problem solve and work hard to overcome challenges, skills that are both tremendously vital for any career. For instance, I am a Star Scout in my Boy Scout troop, and I had to put lots of effort into learning various skills to get to this point, such as cooking, first aid, aquatics, and citizenship. There were several challenges along the way, such as in one of the merit badges called Lifesaving, I had to practice rescuing people with several different swimming strokes and hand motions and dive down ten feet to the bottom of a lake. I struggled with breath support, stamina, and precise arm movements necessary for the merit badge, and I initially wasn’t comfortable with swimming in a lake. Still,  I became more comfortable over time to get the merit badge. These things show how even when I’m faced with several challenges, I have the hard-work and perseverance to work through them. 

Additionally, another one of my major skills for this career is that I am forward looking and plan ahead. For instance, I plan how often I should practice tennis every week to achieve my goals of reaching the school tennis team and playing well during tennis tournaments I go to. Additionally, I plan time to practice things like playing the trumpet and programming, so that I can develop some of my skills and keep improving on them over time. There have been tangible results from this in my grades because I have consistently gotten a 3.8 or 4.0 GPA in school. This is very important in innovation heavy industries such as automotive engineering because in order to improve cars in key aspects, you need to have the ability to look forward and make solid plans accordingly.

Even though automotive engineering is a very competitive and difficult field to get into, I hope that my skills from academics and extracurriculars can get me to that level. Thank you for using some of your time to listen to some information about me. Now if you want to look at some of the programming projects I worked on in this class, feel free to browse around at them.
